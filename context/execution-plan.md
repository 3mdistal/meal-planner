2. ~~Create basic Astro components and layouts~~
3. ~~Create a predefined meal plan structure (e.g., 7 days, 3 meals per day)~~
4. ~~Implement a recipe selection interface using Astro components~~
5. ~~Create a component to display the selected recipes in the meal plan~~
6. Implement local storage to save and retrieve the meal plan

## Stage 2: Ingredient Breakdown and Customizable Plan

4. Add a component to display the generated shopping list
5. Update local storage to accommodate the new data structure

## Stage 3: Custom Recipes and Extended Planning

## Stage 4: External Database Integration

2. Create a database schema for recipes, meal plans, and user data
3. Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations on recipes and meal plans
4. Update the Astro frontend to use API calls instead of local storage
5. Implement user authentication and authorization
6. Add multi-user support, allowing each user to have their own recipes and meal plans

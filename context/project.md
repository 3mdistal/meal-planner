The plan for this app is to make a meal planning app in several stages.

## Stage 1

This will be a very simple app where you can simply pick out recipes and add them to your meal plan (which is predetermined in its structure).

## Stage 2

This will break down recipes into ingredients and give you a shopping list. The UI will also give you an interface to choose how many of which kinds of meals you want to make in the week.

## Stage 3

This will allow you to create your own recipes and add them to your meal plan. The UI will let you now plan more than a week in advance.

## Stage 4

Here, I'll stop using local storage for the app and make it so that the app can connect to an external database. At this point, the app would be usable for people other than me.
